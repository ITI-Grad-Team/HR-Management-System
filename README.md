# HERA: HR Management System

A comprehensive system to manage **hiring**, **tasks**, **attendance**, and **salaries** â€” all in one place.

---

## Overview

This system simplifies HR operations by allowing:

- **Admins** to invite HR users and assign roles.
- **HRs** to create job applications, manage interviews, and approve/reject candidates.
- **Employees** to check in/out, submit tasks, and receive feedback.

Everything from recruitment to payroll reports is handled automatically in the background.

---

## Objectives

-  Automate HR tasks and reduce manual effort.
-  Assist HRs in hiring decisions using AI-powered models.
-  Provide secure JWT-based authentication and role-based access (Admin, HR, Employee).
-  Track attendance including lateness, absence, and overtime with payroll generation.
-  Deliver role-based real-time insights via dashboards.
-  Offer chatbot support for quick HR-related queries in both Arabic and English.
